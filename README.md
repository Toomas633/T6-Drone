## About
This is my first attempt at bulding a drone. It is bult around an F450 frame. 
I used INAV on my boar and the config cli files  as well as a hex file for MATEK F405 CTR flight board are found in the INAV files folder.
3mf Files act as STL files and are meant for 3D printing. There are also model files included in the form of .par and .asm (Solid Edge files).
Due to the size of the prop guard stl file, it can only be found in at Thingiverse or in regular 3D design (.par) form under v0.2 MISC folder.
